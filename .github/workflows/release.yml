# description of this workflow, can be anything you want
name: Package and Release

# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.
# this tag schema only fires on version numbers, though isn't as good as regex "/^v\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?(-\S*)?$/"
# workflow_run is used since a workflow can't be triggered by a tag made by another workflow without OAuth
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v[0-9]+.[0-9]+*

# a workflow is built up as jobs, and within these jobs are steps

  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:

    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
