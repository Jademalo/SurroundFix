# description of this workflow, can be anything you want
name: Package with Artifacts

# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.

# https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#example-using-multiple-events-with-activity-types-or-configuration
# workflows don't show up in the action list until they have been run once.
# if a push to a branch would trigger a workflow, it uses the workflow file in
# the branch or tag that triggered it.
# branches-ignore means that master won't trigger from it's own workflow.
# multiple commits in a single push will only run once.

# a workflow is built up as jobs, and within these jobs are steps
